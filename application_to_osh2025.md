# Call for Talks, Workshops, Performances, Art and Exhibitions - Open Hardware Summit 2025

### Title
Treating sight loss with an open source training device

### Talk Type
5 minute lightning talk

### Tell us what your talk in under 150 words. Be clear and concise.

I had a stroke 2 years ago and lost half my sight (hemianopia - my brain can’t process the left side of anything I see.) 
I found a paper in the Journal of Neuroscience: “Ameliorating Hemianopia with Multisensory Training” which described a 
device which flashed a bright light at the same time as emitting a burst of white noise. The two patients who used the 
device in the paper both recovered a good amount of sight. I wanted to try this out and my brother-in-law (Iain Watt)
built the device for me using open source components (Arduino, speaker, LEDs). 
I’m part of the way through the training protocol using the device and have some exciting preliminary eye test results 
which show that a patch of sight has returned that matches where the training device was situated in my field of vision.


### 3 identifying keywords for your proposal, e.g. “Kitchen Tools”, “3D printing”, and “Chocolate”

"sight loss", "medical device", "stroke"

### Long description: Tell us in depth about your talk in about 500 words. Present your key subject and how you will discuss it. 
I'll describe hemianopia - what it is and how many people it affects. Then talk about the neuroscience paper and how 
multisensory training stimulates more of the brain and boosts the signal from the eyes to aid recovery. I'll show the
promising results from the two patients in the paper. The paper gave a specification for the training device and a list 
of components but no details on how to build it. Iain reverse engineered it and we want to let people know that the
build instructions are available on github. I'll show photos and videos of the device (Mr FlashyBeepy). I'll describe
how Iain built it,incrementally improving the design through several iterations. Hopefully I can finish with the results 
of my own eye test before and after training.
