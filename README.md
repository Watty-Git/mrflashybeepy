## Instructions for Building A Device To Ameliorate Hemianopia

This repo contains documentation and code for reproducing the training device described in the paper
“Ameliorating Hemianopia with Multisensory Training”, Journal of Neuroscience. We are not associated
with the authors of the paper but have reverse engineered the device from the description in the
paper. The device flashes a bright light at the same time as emitting a burst of noise for 500 ms at 
random intervals of 2-6 seconds.

Hemianopia, in which half of the visual field is lost, is a common consequence of stroke or other brain 
injury. In the paper, the two patients who used the device for 10 weeks both recovered a good amount of sight. 
Information on how to build the device can be found in the [build instructions](build_instructions.md) and a 
guide to using the device here: [training schedule](training_schedule.md)
