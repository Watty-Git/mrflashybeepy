# Eye Training Protocol

## Apparatus

Mr FlashyBeeps will flash a bright light at the same time as making burst of noise for 0.5 s. 
The flash and noise are repeated at random intervals of 2-6 seconds. Just switch on at the 
wall socket and the flashy beeps program runs automatically until switched off again.


## Setup

Use a quiet, dimly lit room.
Choose a focal point and position  Mr FlashyBeeps at 45 degrees off to the blind side 
(140 cm from the focal point) and sit 140 cm away from the focal point. This will place 
Mr FlashyBeeps 2 m away from you.

Alternatively, place MrFlashyBeeps 2 m away from you wherever your sight is worst, 
if you donâ€™t have full hemianopia. Trigonometry (sin, cos, tan) will help calculate the position.


## Timing

Once a week for 10 weeks, do 5 repetitions of 8 minutes of focusing on the focal point 
followed by an 8 minute break (40 minutes of training in total).

## Measuring Progress

You can track your progress by asking your optician for a peripheral vision test. Alternatively,
 there is a Free Visual Field Analyzer called [EyesCream](http://www.eyesage.org/).
